# Obfuscated-C

This repository contains some examples of obfuscation in C.
These codes are for experimental and educational purposes only, there shouldn't be anything like that in production, right...?

I won't focus on preprocessor-based obfuscation as I consider this as not very interesting because there isn't some technical details behind just defining every keyword as underscores or nonsense identifiers.
I'm way more curious about esoteric syntaxes and weird logic.
