# Obfuscated-C

This repository contains some examples of obfuscation in C.
These codes are for experimental and educational purposes only, there shouldn't be anything like that in production, right...?

I won't focus on preprocessor-based obfuscation as I consider this as not very interesting because there isn't some technical details behind just defining every keyword as underscores or nonsense identifiers.
I'm way more curious about esoteric syntaxes and weird logic.

## Repository Tree
```
|- README.md
|- obfuscation_guide.c (tutorial file)
|- Directory
|   |- file.c (obfuscated)
|   |- file_explanation.c (step-by-step explanation)
```
`obfuscation_guide.c` introduces some syntaxes and concepts used, as well as some clues about how to proceed to clean the codes.
Be careful, eplanation files will only explain the algorithm step-by-step, without explaining again the syntax, so read the tutorial if you're stuck.
However, if you still don't understand a code after reading the full explanation and the tutorial file, please report the code and what remains obscure for you.
Same thing if an explanation is technically not accurate or even false.

Have fun, and don't do this at your work !
